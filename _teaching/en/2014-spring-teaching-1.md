### Workshop Design
Conducted a hands-on biology lesson for students (grades 8–11), structured into **theoretical and practical segments**:

1. **Theoretical Introduction**:
   - Explained principles of optical microscopy and its role in modern cytology, emphasizing image analysis.
   - Introduced immunohistochemistry using models (primary/secondary antibody interactions).

2. **Practical Demonstration**:
   - Guided students in operating a **Soviet-era LOMO microscope** (personally provided due to lack of equipment).
   - Analyzed live algae (*Spirogyra*) and prepared specimens (e.g., terrestrial worm cross-sections).
   - Extended post-break for **individual mentoring**, allowing deeper observation.

### Impact and Outcomes
- Advocated for institutional microscope procurement to enhance STEM education.
- Students gained hands-on experience, bridging theory and practice.
